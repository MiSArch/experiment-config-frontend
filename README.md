# MisArch - Experiment Config Frontend

The frontend is a convenience feature to allow easier configuration of the current services and replicas.
It dynamically loads all available variables from all services and validates made configurations via their JSONSchema.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a local dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The application will proxy the experiment-config service to the local port 3000.
